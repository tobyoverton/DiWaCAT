# DiWaCAT
Dielectric Wakefield Calculator and Tracker

A Python and C++ based wakefield solver for relativistic electron bunches in dielectric lined waveguides (DLW).

For windows/linux, the FieldSolver_Executable folder must also be downloaded for all parts of DiWaCAT_GUI.exe to run. This folder contains an executable file and dependencies for the C++ based field solver. The full calculator and tracker is given by the DiWaCAT_GUI file. The .py file is included for running on iOS machines. This requires pyqt and pyqtgraph packages to be installed however the field calculator part of the code will not run.

Downloading the zip file of this repository will not include DiWaCAT_GUI.exe or FieldSolver_Executable/DiWaCAT_FieldSolverUI.exe. To download these files correctly either clone the directory or directly download each file from Github rather than using the 1kb file in the zip folder.

For a full outline of capabilities/tips see the UserGuide.pdf file.
